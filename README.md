StartTech Application – CI/CD Enabled Deployment
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the StartTech application, which consists of a frontend and backend service.
The application is fully Dockerized and integrated with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines to automate build and validation processes.

Infrastructure provisioning is handled in a separate repository using Terraform, following best DevOps practices for separation of concerns.
